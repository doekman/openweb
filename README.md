# Mac Open Web

Most simply, [Mac Open Web](https://macopenweb.com) is a collection of open and indie Mac, iOS, and web apps that help promote the open web. 

## Want to contribute?

Gosh yes, thank you so much. [Do a pull request](https://github.com/good/openweb/pulls) or [file an issue](https://github.com/good/openweb/pulls) and I’ll add it. Easy peasy. And thank you.

Tools are listed in the `_data/entries.csv` file ([Table Tool](https://github.com/jakob/TableTool) is an excellent tool for editting this file). The `id` columns in the CSV are for referencing and also to keep a certain order. The `name` column in entries is only there for the human maintainer.

This site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to generate it's [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com). To build this site locally, see the hidden `.ok` file (see [ok-bash](https://github.com/secretGeek/ok-bash "ok makes you smarter and more efficient")) which contains just plain _bash_ commands with comments.

## Where’d this come from? 

These kinds of things aren’t anything new, but the idea for this one came from a note that Brent Simmons sent out to a Slack group, and I thought “Why not?” So I picked it up and ran with it.
